# Project description
Robot Turtles is a board game designed by a Googler to teach kids core coding principles. </br>
"The board game is designed to teach basic programming principles via a series of instruction cards which move the playersâ€™ pieces (turtles) around the board. The basic object of the game is for players to navigate a maze and capture jewels but the gameplay is sneakily teaching them core coding fundamentals, such as using limited syntax to express complex ideas, getting a grasp on order of operations, and learning debugging by being able to undo instructions when they make mistakes. In other words: essential coding skills." </br>
